# PyWebSocketClient

well, it's just a crude port of the [java adamac web socket client](http://github.com/adamac/Java-WebSocket-client)
currently, it does not support the _wss_ scheme (..I am just plain ignorant in python) and is blocking. But at least
works :) ..feel free to modify/reuse the code as you wish, but if you improve it just throw me a push request!

The _websocket3.py_ file contains the client code to be used for python3 (since they changed some stuff related to strings and unicode)
